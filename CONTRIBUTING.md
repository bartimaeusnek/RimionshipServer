# Contributing to Rimionship

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Rimionship Server!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DsFxX5PG67).

Our active community will be eager to assist you. And your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Harmony? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/pardeike/Rimionship/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of the Server

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
